For evaluating SOFI performances with different pixel size

1. Run PixesSize1.m
2. Make the generated images into image stacks in RawData-PixelSize file folder manually
3. Run example.m in file folder 'bSOFI-PixelSize'
4. Copy SOFI reconstructed 3rd images into file folder 'conv_target' and rename them in this format '3rd-20 to 3rd-267'
5. Run PixelSize2.m
6. Run PixelSize3.m



For evaluating SOFI performances with different noise levels

1. Run Noises1.m
2. Make the generated images into image stacks in RawData-Noises file folder manually
3. Run example.m in file folder 'bSOFI-Noises'
4. Run Noises2.m


For generating stacks of blinking frames of rotating target with different frame rates

1. Run FrameRate.m
