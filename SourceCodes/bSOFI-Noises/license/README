1. Overview

	Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is an analysis method to gather
	super-resolved information from a sequence of diffraction-limited optical microscope
	images [1]. This toolbox contains the core tools for analyzing image sequences. It
	features extensions for balancing the SOFI image brightness and for extracting some
	functional information as described in our recent publication [2].

	SOFICUMULANTS uses the MATLAB toolbox for parallel computing on CUDA capable graphics
	cards (GPU) if available. The parallel GPU toolbox is featured since MATLAB R2012a
	and exploits the high computation performance of NVIDIA GPUs.

	A function summary is given in CONTENTS and useful implementation details are found
	in SOFIGRIDS. EXAMPLE shows the analysis of an image sequence.

2. Requirements

	• MATLAB R2012a or newer (previous versions require modifications).
	• A CUDA capable graphics card (GPU) is highly recommended.
	• At least 1GB RAM; 4GB or more is recommended.


3. Installation

	Unpack the archive and add the SOFI folder to the MATLAB path.
